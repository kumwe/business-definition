 * One version of a business definition as it was published, beside the compatibility plan that produced it.
 *
 * Every read of definition history — the published head, the version list, the document a lifecycle change
 * answers with — arrives as this record, so its constructor is where a row coming out of storage is checked
 * against itself: the definition must carry published status, its bytes must hash to the checksum the plan
 * names as its target, its version number must be the one the plan produced, and the record's own lifecycle
 * status must have left draft. A row failing any of those is refused rather than served, which keeps a
 * corrupted or hand-edited catalog from reaching the schema compiler as though it were canonical.
