/**
 * Where one business-definition handle stands in a site's catalog, without any of its definition bytes.
 *
 * `BusinessDefinitionRepository::catalog()` and `entry()` answer with these heads, and every operation on a
 * definition starts from one: the service turns a caller-supplied UUID or handle into an entry, authorizes
 * against its `$id`, and only then loads the draft or a published version. Separating the head from the bytes
 * is what makes that first step cheap, and the head is also what a caller reads to decide its next write —
 * `$draftRevision` is the token an optimistic `saveDraft()` or `publish()` has to quote, and
 * `$publishedVersion` says whether the handle is serving anything yet.
