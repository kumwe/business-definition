/**
 * A business definition's work in progress, checked against itself on the way out of storage.
 *
 * Between publications a handle carries at most one draft, and this is the shape every reader of it gets:
 * `BusinessDefinitionRepository::draft()` and `saveDraft()` both answer with one, and the administrator, REST
 * and console surfaces render it. Two things travel beside the bytes. The revision is the optimistic token the
 * next `saveDraft()` or `publish()` has to quote, so a caller can prove it composed its change against the
 * state it read. The checksum is the digest stored alongside those bytes, and the constructor re-derives it
 * from the definition rather than trusting it, so a draft row that was hand-edited or corrupted in the
 * database is refused here instead of reaching the compatibility analyzer as though it were canonical.
