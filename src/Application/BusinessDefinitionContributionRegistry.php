 * A contributed definition may reference entity types and field types another package ships, so no single
 * provider can be validated on its own; contributions accumulate here and are checked together once the
 * last provider has run. Registration is where ownership is enforced — a contributor may claim only
 * handles inside its own owner namespace, its definition must name the same owner that is registering it,
 * and a handle already claimed is refused rather than overwritten — which is what stops one extension from
 * shadowing another's entity type. Entries are kept in handle order so the validated set does not depend
 * on the order providers happened to run in, and `remove()` withdraws an owner's contributions when its
 * extension is disabled, uninstalled or loses trust.
