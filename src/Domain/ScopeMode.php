 * schema compiler emits a `site_identifier` or `organization_identifier` control column only for the
 * dimensions the mode names, and `RecordScope` refuses any identifier combination the mode does not
 * describe, so the identifiers the query compiler binds into a record statement are always the ones the
 * mode admits. On the request path the site half is read off the execution context rather than taken
 * from caller input, leaving the organization as the only dimension a caller names. Because the stored
 * columns follow from the mode, the compatibility analyzer classifies changing it on a published
 * definition as destructive.
