 * is refused as a search, filter, sort, or report target by the query compiler, cannot be declared
 * sortable at all, and is omitted from the audit metadata listing which fields a write changed.
 * `Public`, `Internal`, and `Confidential` classify the data for the people running the installation
 * without narrowing anything the runtime returns. Fields default to `Internal`, an encrypted
 * `core.secret` field must declare `Secret`, and changing a published field's class is reported as a
 * behaviour-changing difference because the values a caller can already see change with it.
