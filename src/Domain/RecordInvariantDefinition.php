/**
 * A named rule spanning several fields of a record — and, where it says so, its owned lines.
 *
 * Field-level rules judge one value at a time; an invariant is how a definition states a rule that only
 * makes sense across values — an end date after its start, a total agreeing with its lines.
 * `RecordRuleValidator` evaluates every invariant on create and update and reports a failing one as a
 * violation keyed by this handle carrying this message, so the operator-facing wording lives in the
 * definition rather than in the runtime. The condition is a typed `Expression`, never executable code,
 * which is what allows an untrusted definition to declare a rule at all.
 *
 * A condition carrying an `Expression` line aggregation reads the whole owned-line collection rather than
 * the header alone, which is what makes "the total agrees with its lines" an expressible rule rather than
 * an aspiration. `lineDependencies()` names the collections a caller has to gather first, and
 * `isSatisfied()` refuses to judge a rule whose collection was not supplied — so an aggregate rule is
 * never quietly reported as satisfied by a caller that did not read the lines.
 *
 * @since  2.0.0
