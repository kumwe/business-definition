 * SHA-256 checksum are already immutable. That is why the later states are kept in a column beside the
 * version row rather than inside the payload: moving a version through them must never rewrite the bytes
 * the checksum was taken over. The transitions are correspondingly narrow — a draft may only be published
 * to a positive version, publication supersedes the version before it, and an explicit status change
 * accepts nothing but `Superseded`, `Deprecated`, and `Rejected`.
