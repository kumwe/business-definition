 * start life in `$initialState`, and `BusinessRecordService` moves them only by running an action whose
 * transition both matches the record's current state and whose capability the actor holds. Because
 * transition handles are unique across the binding, one handle describes exactly one edge — the same
 * logical move from two different states needs two handles. This constructor is the only validation
 * point, so a binding that exists already has a bounded, closed graph: every edge names declared states,
 * no edge is a self-loop, and the initial state is one of the declared states. What it deliberately does
 * not check is reachability, which is a modelling choice rather than an integrity one.
