/**
 * Validated expression tree behind every business-definition condition and computed-field formula.
 *
 * A definition document carries its conditions and formulas as nested JSON objects, and `fromArray()` is
 * the only way to turn one into this type: it checks the operator vocabulary, the arity, the declared
 * result type, and the type agreement between an operator and its arguments, while bounding nesting
 * depth, node count, and canonical byte size. Holding an instance therefore means the tree has already
 * been proven well formed and bounded, which is what lets `RecordInvariantDefinition`, `FieldDefinition`,
 * `ActionDefinition`, and the persisted schema backfill and transform states use it without re-checking
 * anything. `ExpressionEvaluator` computes the value, `dependencies()` names the field handles a caller
 * must supply first, and `toArray()` returns the same document shape so a tree survives a definition
 * checksum or a stored migration state and comes back identical.
 *
 * One leaf reaches past the record's own fields. `line_aggregate` reduces an owned-line collection to a
 * single value — the count of its lines, or the sum of one line field — so a record invariant can state
 * the most fundamental document rule there is, that a header total agrees with its lines. It is
 * deliberately the narrowest thing that expresses that: one declared collection, one closed reduction,
 * one line field, inside the same byte, node and depth budget every other tree lives under.
 * `lineDependencies()` names what a caller must gather, and it is the caller's job to hand over the whole
 * prepared collection so the rule is judged once for the document rather than once per line.
