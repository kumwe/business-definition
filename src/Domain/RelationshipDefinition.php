/**
 * One declared association between business entities, validated the moment it is constructed.
 *
 * Relationships are the part of an entity contract that reaches another entity's table: the schema
 * compiler turns a singular kind into a target column on the owning record table and a collection kind
 * into a junction or owned-line table, and the delete behaviour becomes the foreign key's action when
 * the target row is removed. Construction settles only what this one relationship can answer for
 * itself — that a required association cannot be nulled away by a delete, that an owned line collection
 * cascades from its owner, and that ordering is reserved for collections. Whether the target exists, is
 * in the same site and scope, and names a reciprocal inverse is `BusinessDefinitionValidator`'s job,
 * because those answers need the rest of the graph.
