/**
 * One classified difference between the published definition version and the draft that would replace it.

 * `BusinessDefinitionCompatibilityAnalyzer` emits one of these per difference it finds, and
 * `CompatibilityPlan` orders and carries them into the publication gate. The path is a slash-separated
 * pointer into the definition document — `/fields/title/required`, `/relationships/author`, `/workflow` —
 * so a reviewer reading a plan sees which part of the contract moved rather than a diff of the whole
 * payload, and the classification is what decides whether publishing needs an explicit confirmation. The
 * pointer charset and the message ceiling are enforced up front because a change, once emitted, becomes
 * part of an immutable published plan that no later correction can rewrite.
